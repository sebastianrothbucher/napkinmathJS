# napkinmathJS
do napkin math inside a &lt;textarea>

To use: type some (any) text: 

<img src="img/screen1.png" alt="Textarea with 'Given I have 2+3='" />

After typing '= ' (i.e. a space after the equals), you'll get the result inserted while you can just type on: 

<img src="img/screen2.png" alt="Textarea with 'Given I have 2+3=5 ' (the result inserted)" />
